# üîê Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the security audit findings for the bot-polimisport repository, focusing on password and privacy-protected information.

**Overall Status: ‚úÖ SECURE** - No sensitive credentials found in the repository.

## Audit Findings

### ‚úÖ Positive Findings

1. **No Credentials in Git History**
   - Verified that `config.json` has never been committed to the repository
   - No `.env` files or other credential files in git history
   - Clean commit history with no exposed secrets

2. **Proper .gitignore Configuration**
   - `config.json` is correctly listed in `.gitignore`
   - Database files (`*.db`) are excluded
   - Virtual environments and cache files are excluded

3. **No Hardcoded Credentials**
   - All credentials are loaded from external `config.json` file
   - No hardcoded usernames, passwords, or tokens in source code
   - Test secrets (like `JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP` in `otp.py`) are documented as fake/test values

4. **Secure Configuration Handling**
   - Credentials are loaded at runtime from config file
   - Config file is not tracked by git
   - Single-user authentication model with Telegram ID verification

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Sensitive Information Handled

The application handles the following sensitive information (all stored securely in `config.json`, which is gitignored):

1. **PoliMi Credentials**
   - Username (codice persona)
   - Password
   - OTP authentication URL (contains 2FA secret)

2. **Telegram Configuration**
   - Bot token
   - User ID (for authorization)

3. **Database**
   - SQLite database file (`polimisport.db`)
   - Contains booking history and course information
   - Properly excluded from git via `.gitignore`

## Recommendations

### üîí For Repository Maintainers

1. **Add Example Configuration File** ‚úÖ (Implemented)
   - Create `config.example.json` with placeholder values
   - Helps users understand required configuration structure
   - Prevents confusion about configuration format

2. **Enhance .gitignore** ‚úÖ (Implemented)
   - Add additional patterns for common secret files
   - Include backup files that might contain sensitive data

3. **Security Documentation** ‚úÖ (Implemented)
   - Add dedicated security section to README
   - Document best practices for credential management
   - Warn users about security considerations

4. **Code Comments** ‚úÖ (Implemented)
   - Add warnings in session_manager.py about credential handling
   - Document that test secrets are not real

### üîê For Users

1. **Protect Your config.json**
   - Never commit `config.json` to git
   - Keep file permissions restrictive (chmod 600 on Linux/Mac)
   - Do not share your config file

2. **2FA Secret Security**
   - The `otpauth_url` contains your 2FA secret
   - Anyone with this URL can generate your OTP codes
   - Treat it like a password

3. **Telegram Bot Token**
   - Keep your bot token private
   - If leaked, revoke it via @BotFather and create a new bot
   - Only authorized user (by ID) can use the bot

4. **Database Backup**
   - If backing up the database, ensure backups are secure
   - Database contains your booking history and course preferences

5. **Running on Shared Systems**
   - Be cautious when running on shared hosting
   - Other users might access your config file
   - Consider using environment variables or encrypted secrets

6. **Deployment Best Practices**
   - Use systemd service with restricted user permissions
   - Set proper file ownership and permissions
   - Keep logs secure as they may contain sensitive information

## Security Best Practices

### Configuration Management

```bash
# Set restrictive permissions on config file (Linux/Mac)
chmod 600 config.json

# Verify config.json is not tracked by git
git status config.json  # Should show: "No such file or directory"
```

### Credential Rotation

If you suspect your credentials have been compromised:

1. **PoliMi Password**: Change immediately via PoliMi services
2. **2FA Secret**: Re-enable 2FA to get new secret and update config
3. **Telegram Bot Token**: 
   - Message @BotFather
   - Send `/revoke` command
   - Select your bot and confirm
   - Create new bot or regenerate token
   - Update `config.json`

### Monitoring

- Regularly check Telegram bot for unauthorized access attempts
- Monitor PoliMi account for unexpected bookings
- Review bot logs for suspicious activity

## Testing Approach

The following security checks were performed:

```bash
# Check git history for config.json
git log --all --full-history -- config.json

# Search for hardcoded credentials
grep -rn "password\|secret\|token" --include="*.py" .

# Verify .gitignore is working
git check-ignore -v config.json

# Check for exposed secrets in commits
git rev-list --all | while read rev; do 
  git ls-tree -r $rev | grep -E "config.json|\.env"
done
```

## Conclusion

The repository is secure and follows best practices for credential management. No sensitive information is exposed in the codebase or git history. Users should follow the recommendations above to maintain security when deploying and using the bot.

## Contact

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:
1. **DO NOT** open a public issue
2. Contact the repository owner directly
3. Provide details of the vulnerability
4. Allow time for a fix before public disclosure
